Code Editor: Abnormal Traffic Detection System
Introduction
Abnormal Traffic Detection is an ML-based system that identifies unusual patterns in traffic flow, vehicle behavior, or network activity. It detects anomalies like traffic spikes, wrong-way movement, or suspicious logs using trained models. Ideal for smart cities and traffic control rooms, it automates monitoring and ensures quick response to potential threats or accidents.

Features
â€¢	Upload traffic data (CSV, logs, or frames)
â€¢	Automatic anomaly detection based on trained ML model
â€¢	Real-time flagging of abnormal patterns
â€¢	Simple, user-friendly interface using Streamlit
â€¢	Supports basic preprocessing, visualization, and analysis
â€¢	Highlights potential issues for review
â€¢	Can be extended to live video feeds or sensor data

Tech Stack
â€¢	Python
â€¢	Scikit-learn (for machine learning)
â€¢	Pandas & NumPy (for data handling)
â€¢	Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
â€¢	OpenCV (optional, if video/image is involved)
